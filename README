Dataset Description
========================
This dataset accompanies work reported in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.339606v1, consisting of structural/functional MRI acquisitions for 19 participants during independent real action and visual localiser sessions.

The /derivates directory contains Region of Interest (ROI) definitions in BrainVoyager compatible .voi files.

OSF Materials

Run Exclusion
=====================
Due to participant errors that were identified during offline video screening, these 2 runs should be excluded from analysis:
- sub-DT12_ses-action_task-grasp_run1.nii.gz (Hand errors throughout)
- sub-KH02_ses-action_task-grasp_run1.nii.gz (Eye errors throughout)

Inconsistent Parameters
=======================
Slightly different aquisition parameters were used for the following participants: 
- sub-ST28_ses-action_task-grasp_run1.nii.gz contains 2 extra volumes (6300 vs. standard 6230) meaning the final 70 volumes (2*35 slices) should be discarded.
- sub-DT12_ses-localiser_task-localiser_run*.nii.gz 

BIDS Conversion
=======================
Converted with dcm2bids 0.4.0.1 (fork at https://github.com/jooh/Dcm2Bids)
